    <h2>
        <p><u>Building a home can be one the biggest undertakings of a lifetime, and although a basic checklist and
                general list of questions won’t cover every aspect, it will help you to weigh the decision and set your
                plans in motion</u></p>

    <div class="item">
        <h2>
            <p><u><b>1) Affordability <br><br> When choosing the house plans and lot, the reality of what you can afford
                        obviously takes precedence. But you shouldn’t stretch your budget thin. In construction, there
                        almost certainly will be unforeseen expenses, such as land grading or groundwater issues that
                        can hinder the home’s completion schedule and cost.</b></u></p>

            <p><u><b>2) Location <br><br> Before settling on a parcel of land, consider things like where the school or
                        city bus stops and the distance to schools, stores and to your place of employment</b></u></P>

            <p><u><b>3) House Plans <br><br> When selecting a home by looking at plans on a computer screen or in a book
                        or magazine, you won’t get an optimal idea of size and layout. Envision the potential home by
                        comparing its size and layout to your current home’s size and layout. Ask yourself if the home
                        has enough or too many windows on the sunny side, if the kitchen is large enough and flows
                        nicely, if the home offers plenty of storage, closets and a usable attic; some things are
                        changeable -- at a cost. </b></u></p>

            <p><u><b>4) The Contractor <br><br>The right contractor can be one of your biggest allies. Before hiring
                        anyone,ask him to direct you to samples of his work and to explain his warranty. Ask how much
                        money he expects up front, which may be a modest down payment but should be never more than
                        half; your bank may only release the funds in partial increments, so ask your lender about
                        payment arrangements. Obtain a copy of the contract.</b></u></p>
